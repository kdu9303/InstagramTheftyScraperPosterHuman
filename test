Certainly! To add logic that unlikes posts that have been liked or unfollows users that have been followed, you will need to maintain a record of the media IDs and user IDs that your bot has interacted with. This can be done using a simple list or by saving this information to a file for persistence.

Here is an updated version of your `perform_human_actions` function with additional logic to unlike and unfollow. This example includes functions to unlike media and unfollow users, and keeps track of liked media and followed users in separate lists. 

### Updated `scrape.py`

```python
import random
from time import sleep
from rich.console import Console

console = Console()

# Initialize lists to keep track of liked media and followed users
liked_media = []
followed_users = []

def perform_human_actions(client, tags):
    if not tags:
        console.print(f"[bold bright_red]No tags provided for human-like actions.[/bold bright_red]")
        return
    
    random_tag = random.choice(tags)
    console.print(f"[bold yellow]Performing human-like actions on tag: {random_tag}[/bold yellow]")
    
    actions = [
        lambda tag: client.hashtag_medias_recent_v1(tag, amount=10),
        lambda tag: client.hashtag_medias_top_v1(tag, amount=9),
        lambda tag: client.hashtag_medias_top(tag, amount=9)
    ]
    
    try:
        action = random.choice(actions)
        medias = action(random_tag)
        
        if medias:
            console.print(f"[bold yellow]Media found using {action.__name__}.[/bold yellow]")
            media = random.choice(medias)
            media_id = media.pk
            client.media_like(media_id)
            liked_media.append(media_id)  # Track liked media
            console.print(f"[bold yellow]Liked random media: {media_id} from tag: {random_tag}.[/bold yellow]")
            
            sleep_time = random.uniform(5, 15)
            console.print(f"[bold yellow]Sleeping for {sleep_time:.2f} seconds to mimic human behavior.[/bold yellow]")
            sleep(sleep_time)
            
            # Example of following the user who posted the media
            user_id = media.user.pk
            client.user_follow(user_id)
            followed_users.append(user_id)  # Track followed user
            console.print(f"[bold yellow]Followed user: {user_id} who posted the media.[/bold yellow]")
        else:
            console.print(f"[bold bright_red]No media found for tag: {random_tag}.[/bold bright_red]")
    except Exception as e:
        console.print(f"[bold red]Failed to perform human-like actions: {e}.[/bold red]")

def undo_human_actions(client):
    # Unlike the posts
    if liked_media:
        for media_id in liked_media:
            try:
                client.media_unlike(media_id)
                console.print(f"[bold yellow]Unliked media: {media_id}.[/bold yellow]")
                sleep(random.uniform(2, 5))  # Sleep to mimic human behavior
            except Exception as e:
                console.print(f"[bold red]Failed to unlike media: {media_id}. Error: {e}[/bold red]")
    
    # Unfollow the users
    if followed_users:
        for user_id in followed_users:
            try:
                client.user_unfollow(user_id)
                console.print(f"[bold yellow]Unfollowed user: {user_id}.[/bold yellow]")
                sleep(random.uniform(2, 5))  # Sleep to mimic human behavior
            except Exception as e:
                console.print(f"[bold red]Failed to unfollow user: {user_id}. Error: {e}[/bold red]")

# Example usage
# Assuming `cl` is your client instance and `tags` is a list of tags
# perform_human_actions(cl, tags)
# undo_human_actions(cl)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Tracking Actions**: 
   - `liked_media`: List to keep track of media IDs that have been liked.
   - `followed_users`: List to keep track of user IDs that have been followed.

2. **Unliking Posts**:
   - The `undo_human_actions` function iterates over the `liked_media` list and unlikes each post.

3. **Unfollowing Users**:
   - The `undo_human_actions` function iterates over the `followed_users` list and unfollows each user.

4. **Sleeping Between Actions**:
   - Adding a random sleep interval between actions to mimic human behavior and reduce the risk of detection.

### Usage:

- Call `perform_human_actions(cl, tags)` to perform the human-like actions.
- Call `undo_human_actions(cl)` to undo the actions (unlike posts and unfollow users).

This setup ensures that your bot can perform human-like actions and also provides functionality to undo these actions if needed.
