## Version 3.1.1 - August 22, 2024

### New Features and Enhancements

1. **Version Control Integration**
   - Added a `version.txt` file to manage version control, allowing the program to display information such as the creator, version number, and the last known working date at startup.
   - Example format for `version.txt`:
     ```json
     {
         "created_by": "Sujay1599",
         "program_name": "InstagramTheftyScraperPosterHuman",
         "version": "3.1.1",
         "working_as_of": "2024-08-22"
     }
     ```

2. **Improved Status Management**
   - Enhanced the `update_status()` function to merge lists (e.g., `reels_scraped`) while ensuring no duplicates are added.
   - Used sets in `scrape.py` to track `reels_scraped` and convert them back to lists for JSON storage, preventing duplication.

3. **Human-like Behavior Simulation**
   - Refined the `perform_human_actions()` function to include randomized human-like behaviors, such as liking, following/unfollowing, and commenting on posts.
   - Improved the `random_sleep()` function to log wait times, adding more randomness and realism to the bot's actions.

4. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**
   - Added comprehensive logging across all functions to track execution, errors, and specific actions like waits and deletions.
   - Improved error handling in functions like `scrape_reels()` and `handle_rate_limit()` to manage issues like rate limits and failed scrapes/upload attempts gracefully.

5. **File Management and Initialization**
   - Implemented automatic initialization for JSON files such as `status.json` using `initialize_json_file()` and `initialize_status_file()` to ensure they are properly set up with default values.
   - Enhanced file cleanup with functions like `delete_old_reels()` and `delete_uploaded_files()` to manage storage efficiently by deleting old or unnecessary files.

6. **Progress Feedback**
   - Integrated a progress bar during sleep intervals with the `sleep_with_progress_bar()` function to provide visual feedback during long-running operations.

7. **Configuration and Flexibility**
   - All behaviors (e.g., scraping intervals, uploading intervals, human-like actions) are configurable via a `config.yaml` file, making it easy to customize the bot's actions to suit different use cases.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sujay1599/InstagramTheftyScraperPosterHuman.git
   cd InstagramTheftyScraperPosterHuman
   ```

2. **Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run `config_setup.py` to create the `config.yaml` file:**
   ```bash
   python config_setup.py
   ```
   Follow the prompts to enter your configuration details. This will generate a `config.yaml` file with the necessary settings, including encrypted Instagram credentials, proxy settings, default descriptions, and comments.

### How to Update

1. **Download the latest version** of the program.
2. **Update your `version.txt` file** to reflect the new version information:
   ```json
   {
       "created_by": "Sujay1599",
       "program_name": "InstagramTheftyScraperPosterHuman",
       "version": "3.1.1",
       "working_as_of": "2024-08-22"
   }
   ```
3. **Ensure that your `config.yaml` file** is updated according to your requirements, making use of the new configurations available.
4. **Run the program** as usual to start using the new features.

### Known Issues

- **Rate Limit Handling**: The program now has improved rate limit handling, but it's still possible to encounter rate limits if the bot is run too frequently. Adjust the scrape/upload intervals in `config.yaml` to mitigate this.
- **Duplication Check**: The new status management should prevent duplicates in `reels_scraped`, but if you encounter any issues, ensure the status file is properly initialized and updated.
